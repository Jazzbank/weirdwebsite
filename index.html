        <p><a href="https://jazzbank.github.io/milestoner/" target="_blank">Milestoner</a><br>This is an incremental game about having one upgrade, and getting milestones every so often. This game is not currently fully abandoned, but chances that the next update comes is quite rare.</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://jazzbank.github.io/incrematter/" target="_blank">Incrematter</a><br>This is an incremental game inspired by the likes of Antimatter Dimensions. It basically has the same idea of polynomial growth, along with making the game have an overall sleek look. This game is fully abandoned.</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://jazzbank.github.io/The-Progression-Tree/" target="_blank">The Progression Tree</a><br>This is my first attempt at making a working, reasonable The Prestige/Modding Tree (TPT/TMT) game. This is not fully abandoned, and I may even work on it occasionally.</p>

        <p>There may be new stuff sometimes, so if you're interested, check back if you want any time in the future. I may attempt on creating a new incremental game. We'll see...</p>
